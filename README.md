# M5-LoRaWAN-RAK

## Overview

### SKU:U184-CN470、U184-EU868、U184-US915、U184-AS923

**Unit LoRaWAN-CN470**、**Unit LoRaWAN-EU868** 、**Unit LoRaWAN-US915** 、**Unit LoRaWAN-AS923**  is a LoRaWAN communication module based on LoRa technology, specifically designed for the EU868 frequency band, suitable for Europe and other regions using the EU868 frequency band. The module adopts the **STM32WLE5** solution, supporting long-range communication with low power consumption and high sensitivity characteristics. The module integrates the LoRaWAN protocol stack and supports three operating modes: **Class A, Class B, and Class C**. It also supports point-to-point (P2P) communication mode and uses a UART communication interface (controlled by the AT command set) for flexible configuration. Additionally, the product features a high-performance **rubber antenna**, with an optimized antenna design that provides more stable signal coverage and longer communication distance, making it suitable for various complex environments. The module can be used as a data collection node to connect to a gateway for data collection and management, or it can enable direct communication between devices in scenarios where no gateway is needed. It is widely used in long-range, low-power IoT communication scenarios, such as smart agriculture, industrial monitoring, and environmental monitoring node deployments.
