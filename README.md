**Unit LoRaWAN-CN470**, **Unit LoRaWAN-AS923**, **Unit LoRaWAN-EU868**, **Unit LoRaWAN-US915** is a LoRaWAN communication module based on LoRa technology. The module adopts the **RAK3172 (STM32WLE5)** solution, supporting long-range communication with low power consumption and high sensitivity characteristics. The module integrates the LoRaWAN protocol stack and supports three operating modes: **Class A, Class B, and Class C**. It also supports point-to-point (P2P) communication mode and uses a UART communication interface (controlled by the AT command set) for flexible configuration. Additionally, the product features a high-performance **rubber antenna**, with an optimized antenna design that provides more stable signal coverage and longer communication distance, making it suitable for various complex environments. The module can be used as a data collection node to connect to a gateway for data collection and management, or it can enable direct communication between devices in scenarios where no gateway is needed. It is widely used in long-range, low-power IoT communication scenarios, such as smart agriculture, industrial monitoring, and environmental monitoring node deployments. 

**Atom DTU LoRaWAN‑CN470**, **Atom DTU LoRaWAN-EU868**, **Atom DTU LoRaWAN‑US915** The module employs the **RAK3172 (STM32WLE5)** solution, supporting long‑range communication with both low power consumption and high sensitivity. The module has a built‑in LoRaWAN protocol stack, supporting **Class A, Class B and Class C** operation modes for easy connection to various LoRaWAN server platforms such as TTN, Chirpstack, Actility, Tencent Cloud, etc.; It also supports LoRa® point‑to‑point (P2P) communication mode and uses a UART communication interface (controlled via the AT command set) for flexible configuration, and integrates an **RS485** communication interface to provide reliable wired connectivity for industrial field devices. The product uses a high‑performance **rubber‑duck antenna**, with an optimized design to deliver more stable signal coverage and longer communication range, suitable for various complex environments. In LoRaWAN mode, the module can act as a node to connect to a gateway for data collection and management; In P2P mode, it can achieve direct device‑to‑device communication without a gateway. It is widely used in long‑range, low‑power IoT communication scenarios such as smart agriculture, industrial monitoring, and environmental monitoring node deployments.
